# WinSock-Terminal-Live-Chat-Server-and-Client
Multi-client server built in C++ on Visual Studio using WinSock API, Wireshark, and PuTTY.

All can be easily integrated into a GUI for a live-chat server.

Server and client are based on some of the structures offered by Sloan Kelly (https://bitbucket.org/sloankelly/youtube-source-repository/src/8a4847e8ca5f9f039a7246a1172aa87f64ef55c5/cpp/networking/?at=master).

Prime generation from given passwords could be improved in performance and made less symmetrical by implementing the The Sieve of Eratosthenes or Sieve of Atkin.
